          As part of our self-discovery we found pursuing media that features
          Plural or Mentally Ill characters to be helpful. Realizing that
          finding media with this theme could be challenging, however, we
          decided to create Brain Problem Games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brain Problem Games is an open-source list of game reviews that
          discuss themes of mental health or plurality. The site can be freely
          forked to allow others to add items (after all, we could not write
          reviews for games we have not played)
        </p>

        <p>
          The site itself is constructed on Jekyll (yes I know that's ironic
          given the topic), a Static Site Generator. Github will host Static
          Site Generators free of charge. This also means individual entries are
          Markdown, making it accessible for free editing by others.
