          It/its pronouns are my personal preference, but any pronouns for me
          are fine.

          I handle the work persona, though I think of myself as a
          task-performing android assistant. Or at times, a rogue one who knows
          better than its owner (or other alters).

          I'm using my section as a list of our programming accomplishments, as
          that is what I am most proud of. My personal ability to keep us
          on-task, focused, and consistent with our output, work-related or
          otherwise.
