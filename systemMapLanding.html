          If you somehow got here without knowing what Plurality is: It is when
          two or more beings reside within the same physical body. It is
          medically referred to as Dissociative Identity Disorder, formerly
          called Multiple Personality Disorder.

          "Nova" does not have a single cohesive identity, but instead,
          multiple. Like any collection of people, we can talk, argue, discuss,
          and plan amongst ourselves. What follows is our best understanding of
          ourselves, and our personal websites.

          Each person has customized their own website to their own desire,
          whether it be a blog, a collection of blinkies, or near-empty.
