          And thus I enter a lovely new chapter: One of self-acceptance, one of
          self-love. For far too long have I hid from who I am. We are
          complicated, we are strange, and we have come to the conclusion that
          being more open is necessary for continued health and wellbeing.
          It's... so freeing, but so scary.

          But what cause do I have to speak so ominously of it? This is a joyous
          moment. This is exciting for us. Instead of worrying, I'll just end on
          a thrilled note:

          We are Nova. We are the Stardust System. And it's so lovely finally
          understanding who I am, and who we are.

          Anyway, expect me to use this section to sort out my thoughts... or
          post bread. I'm an avid baker.
