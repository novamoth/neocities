          I am Medium. The connecting silence and emptiness--the nebula, the
          scattered starstuff.

          Or to be less fantastical for just a moment... I am a "system mom" of
          sorts. Additionally, I'm one of the primary "socialites" of the
          system, and effectively function as an autism mask given sentience. My
          hobbies include baking, cooking, witchcraft, and a variety of similar
          things. I try to keep everything together, in a sense, and try to
          foster our continued growth as a person, system, and social entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an alternative-identity sense, I think of myself as a Fae Matron of
          some kind, some playful and caring eternal entity with a touch of
          ominous energy. I also have "librarian vibes", apparently, hence the
          library aesthetic on this portion of the site.

          Thank you for taking the care to read this over. It means the world.
