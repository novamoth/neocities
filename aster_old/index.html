          <p>Hello! I'm Aster :3</p>
          <p>She/It pronouns!</p>
          <p>
            I spent all this time working on the website as a whole but I think
            I just realized that I'm mostly going to use this place as like. A
            blinky collection lmaoooo
          </p>
          <p>
            BUT I'LL STILL DO MY BEST TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. I'm the chill one,
            I'm the silly one, I'm the one who hangs out with good friends and
            giggles at everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm the star. The thing everything orbits. The host of the show!
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay but calling myself the star sounds really selfish and literally
            self-centered but like. Look it's just kinda personal cosmology.
            Fake lore for funsies. Why not? And hey, I'm the one who is like,
            literally always glowing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll probably tuck extra special extra pages off to the side. Maybe
            I'll infodump about lucid dreaming sometime. Or maybe I already
            have? CHECK OUT THE SIDE NAV!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Talking about myself is hard so IT'S BLINKY STICKER TIME,
            SUCKERS!!!!
